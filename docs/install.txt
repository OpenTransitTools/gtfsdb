GTFSDB Installation
===================

# ~/gtfsdb-0.1.6 $
python build.py build

Install only for this user. Python packages install to $HOME/.local
(looks like the local directory we used before, but its different,
note the dot before local), so you'll need to add $HOME/.local/bin to
your shell's path.

# ~/gtfsdb-0.1.6 $
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin

# ~/gtfsdb-0.1.6 $
python build.py install --user

Gtfsdb requires the psychopg2 database driver. If it is not available
in your linux package system, download & install locally using the
same technique as for gtfsdb. It will require the python and postgresql
development packages in order to build.
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2/

Gtfsdb also requires geoalchemy 0.7.2, and sqlalchemy 0.8.4 (not 0.9.x 
which are the newest version) availabe at
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GeoAlchemy/0.7.2 and
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SQLAlchemy/0.8.4 respectively, and are
both installed using the same "build", "install --user" technique. You
may have to remove the SQLAlchemy version 0.9.x if that had been
installed automatically by accident, in order for gtfsdb to find the
correct 0.8.4 version.
